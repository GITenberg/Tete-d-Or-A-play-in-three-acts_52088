<p class="blockquot">
O day! Having felt, like the touch of water upon the head,<br />
The desire to be alone and to weep where none could find me,<br />
Laughing I walked where the fragrance of the riotous garden spread<br />
Its honeyed share, and left the flowers and the trees behind me.<br />
<br />
And from behind me, borne from the breathing depths, as I went,<br />
With eyes half-closed, there came to fall upon my hair<br />
The holy benediction of things most excellent,<br />
And seeds and shreds of down were softly mingled there.<br />
<br />
Behind me the eternal woods uplifted leafy domes,<br />
Behind me banks of blossoms, packed to the brim with sweets,<br />
Towards the expectant nose, prepared to breathe their balms,<br />
Like some strong nuptial body upraised their ardent heats.<br />
<br />
Roses and yellow asphodels that sturdy stems upbear,<br />
In the mellow disarray of their golden panoply,<br />
Shone forth like lamps that gleam through the white and liquid air<br />
When but a single diamond adorns the sleeping sky.<br />
<br />
For like one who stops and turns and listens to the sea<br />
When to his ear is borne its low, mysterious whisper,<br />
Above the shining earth, beaming resplendently,<br />
I saw that star, First-Born of the dawning Future, Vesper!<br />
<br />
O only child of the King, among so many slaves!<br />
Pilgrim unique o'er city paths seeking the distant sea!<br />
Planet of morn, re-born in evening's dusky caves!<br />
Star anadyomene in the depth of the garden's greenery!<br />
<br />
Mysteriously o'er the hour a subtle influence reigns,<br />
Deepening peace, maintaining, with strange and mystic art,<br />
The secret length of the days that are gone where only the honey remains<br />
Of animate life, enhived in this everlasting heart.<br />
<br />
Feebly the dying breeze stirs in its dark retreat.<br />
O joy supreme, O love beyond what words can say!<br />
Over this sordid world that has so enslaved my feet<br />
Endureth the ineffable unfolding of the day!<br />
<br />
In such an hour there passes in laughing ecstasy<br />
The poet, sprung from a race obscure, who never shall grow old,<br />
His golden dream fulfills itself in the twilight. Silently<br />
He is merged in the springtime of the gods, the eternal age of gold!<br />
<br />
Gazing into the eye of the world with an eye on fire to see,<br />
As one gapes for the juicy plums that the topmost branches bear,<br />
As, 'twixt his dusky brides, hard Jacob bowed the knee<br />
To gain from the hand of a father the blessing on an heir,<br />
<br />
I live! Come, rain and storm! I shall not be unmanned!<br />
Bearing my destiny, aware of the term of Fate's delay,<br />
Laughing I walked beneath the grim and terrifying land<br />
Of burning constellations that cross a milky way.<br />

<p><i>The open fields at the end of winter.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter, at the back,</i> <span class="smcap">simon agnel</span>, <i>dressed like a peasant.
He bears upon his shoulder the body of a woman,
and carries a spade.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter, in front,</i> <span class="smcap">cébès</span>, <i>walking slowly.</i></p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: I stand here,</p>

<p>Untaught, irresolute,</p>

<p>A man new-born confronting things unknown.</p>

<p>I turn my face towards the Future and the lowering
arch of the sky. My soul is full of weariness!</p>

<p>I know nothing. There is nothing I can do. What
shall I say? What shall I do?</p>

<p>How shall I use these hands that hang at my sides,
these feet</p>

<p>That bear me about as in a dream?</p>

<p>Speech is but a noise and books are only paper.</p>

<p>There is no one here but myself. And all that is
about me,</p>

<p>The foggy air, the rich fields,</p>

<p>The trees, the low-lying clouds</p>

<p>Seem to speak to me, soundlessly, to ask inarticulate
questions.</p>

<p>The ploughman</p>

<p>Turns homeward with his plough. I hear its slow
creaking.</p>

<p>It is the time when women bring water from the wells.</p>

<p>It is night.&mdash;What am I?</p>

<p>What am I doing? For what do I wait?</p>

<p>And I answer, "I do not know!"</p>

<p>And in my heart there is a wild desire</p>

<p>To weep or to cry aloud</p>

<p>Or to laugh or leap in the air and wave my arms!</p>

<p>"Who am I?"</p>

<p>There are still some patches of snow. I hold in my
hand a sprig of pussy-willow.</p>

<p>For March is like a woman blowing a fire of green
wood.</p>

<p>&mdash;That the Summer</p>

<p>And the dreadful day under the glare of the sun may be
forgotten,</p>

<p>O Nature,</p>

<p>Here I offer myself to you!</p>

<p>I know so little!</p>

<p>Look at me! There is something that I need.</p>

<p>But what it is I do not know and I could cry forever</p>

<p>Loud and low like a child that one hears in the distance,
like children left alone beside the glowing
embers!</p>

<p>O lowering sky! Trees, earth, darkness, night of rain!</p>

<p>Look upon me! Grant my prayer!</p>

<p class="indic">(He sees <span class="smcap">simon</span>.</p>

<p>Who is that?</p>

<p class="indic">(He approaches him.</p>

<p>Are you digging a drain? It is getting late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>straightening his back</i>): Who is there? What
do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: What are you doing there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Does this field belong to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: It is my father's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Suffer me to dig this hole in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span> (<i>seeing the body</i>): What is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>continuing to dig</i>): The woman who was with
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Who is she? Oh, I know her! And is she
dead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I did not cause her death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Oh! Oh! It is she! It is she!</p>

<p>And is it thus that I find you! Cold and wet!</p>

<p>You that were kind to all, light-hearted, vital!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Cébès!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: What? You know me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: What do they call that slate-roofed belfry,
Cébès?</p>

<p>What place is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Agnel! Simon Agnel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Are any of my family still here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: No. The house has been sold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Is my father alive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: He is dead, and your mother also.</p>

<p>The others have gone away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Is it so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Where have you been, unhappy man? Why
did you go?</p>

<p>And what of that woman lying there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Why? Who knows?</p>

<p>A wild and adventurous spirit, shame,</p>

<p>A desire to reach the end of the road, to follow the
lure of the plain that stretches towards the horizon,</p>

<p>And I went out from the house and left the old familiar
faces.</p>

<p>Dead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Where did you go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I did not know that she loved me.</p>

<p>One day I caught her by the throat, crushing her body
against the side of the barn,</p>

<p>For I was a violent man. She came to join me.</p>

<p>I have wandered,</p>

<p>I have dreamed many dreams, I have known</p>

<p>Men and the things that at present exist.</p>

<p>I have seen strange roads, strange cultures, strange
cities. One leaves them behind and they are gone.</p>

<p>And the sea that is very far away and further than the
sea.</p>

<p>And as I was returning, bringing back the branch of
a pine...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: It was there that she found you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Together</p>

<p>By many mountains and rivers we wandered seeking
the South and that other ocean.</p>

<p>Then we returned to this place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Where did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: There, to that hut. I tried to light a fire but
it was too wet.</p>

<p>&mdash;I think it is deep enough now.</p>

<p class="indic">(He climbs out of the hole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: O that she should be lying there like this!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: O this place! This place!</p>

<p>Turning hence my unworthy eyes what have I sought
among multitudes of men but the testimony of my
own soul!</p>

<p>And it was here that, girding up its loins, it came to
find me!</p>

<p>Standing in the red of the dawn, the warmth of the
rising sun on our hair,</p>

<p>We had re-united our souls through our lips, and with
artless arms she clasped me to her breast!</p>

<p>And I brought her here that this place whence I had
set out might mock me! There she lies fallen at
my feet!</p>

<p>My curse on this country! A murrain on the cattle!
May the pigs die of plague!</p>

<p>Ah! Ah! This place! O soil of sticky clay!</p>

<p>I am worthless! What could I do! What was the
use! Ah, why should I try to be</p>

<p>Different from what I am? And it is here</p>

<p>That alone and with my feet in the earth I raise my
bitter cry,</p>

<p>While the wind masks my face with rain!</p>

<p>O woman, ever faithful</p>

<p>Who followed me, uncomplaining</p>

<p>Like a fairy in thrall, like a queen</p>

<p>Who wraps her bleeding feet in tatters of cloth of
gold!</p>

<p>I cried to her, "Come, down into the mud!"</p>

<p>Horror incarnate, shame, infamy teeming with desires,
this is the knowledge I have gained at the last!</p>

<p>Listen! When she was dying she pressed my hand
against her cheek,</p>

<p>And kissed me, keeping her eyes on mine,</p>

<p>And she said that she could sing me prophecies</p>

<p>Like an old ship that has come to the end of the world.</p>

<p>And at the last when she was dying she tried to speak,</p>

<p>Tears were in her eyes! Who knows what she saw,
what she regretted!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Alone and so pale!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: She looked at me and wept and kissed my hands
with burning lips!</p>

<p>"Are you in pain?" I said.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>She looked at me and I do not know what she wished
to say. Who can understand a woman?</p>

<p>Into the grave with you!</p>

<p class="indic">(He lifts the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: May I help you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Yes. I shall be glad of your help. It shall not
be forgotten.</p>

<p>I will take her shoulders, you take her feet.</p>

<p class="indic">(They take up the body.</p>

<p>Not like that! Let her sleep face downward.</p>

<p class="indic">(They lower her face downward, into the grave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: May she sleep well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: There! Go! Enter, enter into the raw earth!
Lie at your ease, hearing nothing, seeing nothing,
your mouth pressing against the clay,</p>

<p>As in the days when prone upon our pillows we rushed
towards sleep!</p>

<p>And now I shall load a burden of earth on your back!</p>

<p class="indic">(He throws the earth into the grave. When
it is full he walks on it, stamping it down.</p>

<p>Fill it up! Room must be found for the earth whose
place you have taken.</p>

<p>&mdash;So there are none of my family left?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Not one. The house is closed. The fields lie
fallow.</p>

<p class="indic">(Silence.</p>

<p>Her father is still alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Would you have me ask him for a night's
lodging?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: He is old. He has known much sorrow.</p>

<p>He lives alone, an object of charity, despised by everyone.</p>

<p>He is bent like a scythe. His hands hang down below
his knees. He has never been the same since his
daughter went away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I shall come to this place no more.</p>

<p>Can you see where the grave was?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: There is not a sign of it. How it rains!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: O gentle Giver of Knowledge,</p>

<p>Twofold teacher who while you spoke held your face
before me like a book,</p>

<p>Here take your rest, deeper than the buried grain!</p>

<p>Here, where you cannot hear the noise of the roads or
the fields, the sounds of ploughing and sowing,</p>

<p>Remembered only by me, in a place that no one knows,</p>

<p>And let not even this spade nor your staff like the
broken oar of a sailor</p>

<p>Remain to mark your grave!</p>

<p class="indic">(He throws away the spade.</p>

<p>And now let us go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: May I go with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Come.</p>

<p>You do not talk, comrade.</p>

<p class="indic">(They walk along together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Oh, I am sad! I am exceedingly sad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Death!</p>

<p>Thoughts,</p>

<p>Actions that sleep, like new-born babes</p>

<p>Drawing up their knees to their bellies reassume</p>

<p>The shape of the maternal mold.</p>

<p>One ceases to live.</p>

<p>Old age obscures the memory. The sick man</p>

<p>Wakes all alone and while the rain drives against the
windows, he hears the sound of a falling silver
spoon.</p>

<p>And the smile has mercifully been given to the old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: She is dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: A woman has withdrawn her hand from mine,
mysteriously veiling her eyes.</p>

<p>And I, her mate, am left alone.</p>

<p>To what pale region of the air shall I raise my yearning
mouth?</p>

<p>What shall I repeat in my silence, "I shall find strength,
I shall make the effort...."</p>

<p>Ah, where shall I look? Where shall I go? The
skies are like iron and I remain here, the woman's
legacy, full of vague menaces and anguished cries.</p>

<p>&mdash;What is there left in life? I have travelled. I have
seen the world. O worthless calendar of petty days!</p>

<p>Though the members of my body</p>

<p>Should bristle as thick as fir saplings upon a mountain
side,</p>

<p>For what would I employ that multitude?</p>

<p>The woman I loved is no more!</p>

<p>And yet... When she was sleeping yesterday, I went
out</p>

<p>Knowing that the next day I should be alone.</p>

<p>It was night and my heart was heavier than a suspended
stone.</p>

<p>But, as I walked to and fro, slowly there came to me</p>

<p>A sense of the living force within my soul, the vital
essence,</p>

<p>That does not enter into marriage, nor pass through
the gates of birth,</p>

<p>The secret purpose of my being.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: O that I also might...</p>

<p>But no one has ever bothered about me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: What did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: I could tell you...</p>

<p>I could lament in such a fashion that you would comprehend....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Some woman already...?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Indeed the desire</p>

<p>For this being who has the face of a child</p>

<p>Is strange. I do not believe in their laughter.</p>

<p>Age makes them fat like fowls.</p>

<p>But to slip away thus like a handful of sand that runs
through the fingers...</p>

<p>Pah! These fancies!</p>

<p>Perhaps some day you will understand.</p>

<p class="indic">(They come to the road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Who is that? (<i>aside</i>) It is her father.</p>

<p class="indic">(An old man, bent almost double, enters,
trundling a wheelbarrow on which is a
basket and a hoe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>aside</i>): Speak to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span> (<i>to the peasant</i>): Good evening.</p>

<p class="indic">(<span class="smcap">the peasant</span> stops and sets down the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p class="indic">(Silence.</p>

<p>How are things going to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Peasant</span>: Eh, I don't know. I think it can't be
more than five o'clock. The days don't get much
longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>shouting in his ear</i>): And how is your daughter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Peasant</span>: I don't know. She is not with me any
more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Perhaps she is better off than you are, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Peasant</span>: Ah! She might help me out a bit then.</p>

<p>'Tis a bad business, surely!</p>

<p>Good-night to you, masters.</p>

<p class="indic">(He goes out. They remain silent for a
moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span> (<i>pointing up the road</i>): That way lies the village.</p>

<p>You must spend the night with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: No, my road lies yonder.</p>

<p>There is now no place to receive me. I will not lodge
in the house of another.</p>

<p>I have no other wealth than these old clothes. But I
shall stretch myself on a stone and be content.</p>

<p>I myself am my table and my bed.</p>

<p>I shall not die, but live!</p>

<p>I shall not die, but live!</p>

<p>I wish not to die, but to live!</p>

<p>For I am not alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Who is with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: The voice of my living soul!</p>

<p>I have heard men mourn their misfortunes, but what
misfortune can there be?</p>

<p>None.</p>

<p>&mdash;It grows dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: It is night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Watch the road and speak more softly.</p>

<p>The dry brambles shiver; the branches creak or sway
without a sound; the brooks gurgle among the reeds.</p>

<p>We stand in the midst of space, with all about us the
blackness,</p>

<p>The melancholy of Earth.</p>

<p>We pass along the road.</p>

<p>And we alone exhale the warm breath of living beings.</p>

<p>Haha! My nerves are unstrung.</p>

<p>You there ... Cébès... Do you hear me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Speak to me. Had you not something to tell
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: I want...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Nothing!</p>

<p>Only a room when it snows and that no one should
know where I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: What did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: I am only a boy. There has been no one to
help me!</p>

<p>I have had to endure much suffering.</p>

<p>I am plagued with bitter fancies. I shrink from the
light of the sun.</p>

<p>Why should you force me to speak only to mock at me?
<span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I will take you by the hair of your head and
shake you.</p>

<p>Come, in whom will you confide if not</p>

<p>In the man who at this very moment</p>

<p>Walks at your side through the blackness of night.</p>

<p>I tell you that you are a man and not a child, like some
pale seedling pushing its way through the mould.</p>

<p>I am only a little older than you,</p>

<p>Yet I have sworn</p>

<p>To hold myself erect!</p>

<p>To never yield, to have no fear, and to accomplish
what I undertake!</p>

<p>Speak! Take my arm</p>

<p>For the night is so dark one can scarcely see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Ah, well! I am very wretched! O that I might
set forth clearly things that are obscure!</p>

<p>Where shall I begin?</p>

<p>To express the weariness that has no beginning, but
has become a part of one's consciousness like the
familiar things of every day?</p>

<p>Thus might the young man speak</p>

<p>Who like an emperor dethroned, his head thrust
through a sack, sits motionless with haggard eyes,</p>

<p>While the wind makes free with his hair like a wanton
trull,</p>

<p>Vacantly contemplating the dawn of another day</p>

<p>Full of little whisperings like a dead tree;</p>

<p>The multitude of foolish men who interrogate each
other, fight, talk, and cast their eyes this way and
that,</p>

<p>And then, turning towards us the hairy side of the head,
disappear like the Manes;</p>

<p>The catastrophes and the sombre passions;</p>

<p>The clouds that cover the hills with shadows; the cries
of beasts, the hum of the villages, the clatter of the
highways;</p>

<p>The wood, and the chant of the coursing wind; the
carts that are charged with sheaves and flowers;</p>

<p>And the Victories that pass their appointed way like
harvesters, with swarthy cheeks,</p>

<p>Veiled and bearing a drum on a golden thigh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Finish. What would he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Nothing. Are there not men whose eyes</p>

<p>Melt like the broken medlar that scatters abroad its
pips,</p>

<p>And women with cancer at work in their bodies, like
the amadou in the beech?</p>

<p>And monstrous births, men having the muzzles of
oxen?</p>

<p>And children violated and murdered by their fathers,</p>

<p>And old men whose children grudgingly count the days
that still are left them?</p>

<p>All the diseases spy upon us, ulcer and abscess, epilepsy
and shaking palsy and at the last, comes gout and
the gravel that clogs urination.</p>

<p>Phthisis lights its fire; the pudenda grow mouldy like
grapes; and the bag of the belly</p>

<p>Breaks and empties out entrails and excrements.</p>

<p>Is it not horrible? But our life,</p>

<p>Spreading a feast, stuffs itself with a banquet of crawling
maggots</p>

<p>Till, like a dog who vomits worms and morsels of meat,</p>

<p>The loaded belly revolts and disgorges it all on the
table!</p>

<p>I long for happiness!</p>

<p>But I am like a man beneath the earth in a cell no sound
can enter.</p>

<p>Who will open the door? Who will descend into the
blackness of my dungeon, bearing in his hand the
yellow flame?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I also lie in that secret place.</p>

<p>I shall arise and burst open the door and I shall appear
before men!</p>

<p>Ah! Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Do not speak! Ah!</p>

<p class="indic">(He stops.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: What ails you? Why do you snuff the air?
What do you smell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: The air and the earth. Ah!</p>

<p>O the Spring that renews the year and the strong love
that triumphs over virginity!</p>

<p>O the ferment of life when the Springtime prepares its
nuptials! There is not a thing that grows</p>

<p>But feels the divine delirium entering like a creator,
producing the flower and the seed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: The wind is warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I have in my mouth the bitter savor of buds!
The block</p>

<p>Of my body</p>

<p>Like a clod of frozen earth</p>

<p>Thaws! O juice of life! Force and acquisition!
Strength and the rising sap!</p>

<p>I will open wide my jaws and I will raise my arms and
hold them extended like branches!</p>

<p>But come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Where are you taking me? Why have we left
the road?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Why do we need a road? I know my way.
Follow me!</p>

<p>O Cébès in this you were right that not to an older man
nor to any one of an age unlike your own did you
address yourself so obscurely,</p>

<p>For they could not answer you, not knowing what you
ask.</p>

<p>But if one can tell the vintage of a wine by its taste</p>

<p>Why should we not believe that each generation of men</p>

<p>Springing from the maternal furrow in its season</p>

<p>Keeps a common secret, a changeless knot in the hidden
texture of its wood?</p>

<p>(Or rather I think of a carpet whose maker disposes
the colors one after the other)</p>

<p>&mdash;And a baby is weaned at eleven months, but the
weaning of the spirit is slower.</p>

<p>And till he learns to forage for himself (the amount
being equal to the expenditure) the breast is not
taken away, the communication with the source.</p>

<p>&mdash;So if you put your ear against my heart&mdash;... But
I myself am full of sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: We are going further and further.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: As for me, I have never tried to fathom</p>

<p>What lay in the heart of anyone, young or old.</p>

<p>But a tree has been my father and my preceptor.</p>

<p>For often when I was a child</p>

<p>A black and bitter humor overwhelmed me,</p>

<p>Making all company hateful, the air breathed by others
a poison,</p>

<p>So that I fled into solitude there to obscurely nourish
this grief that I felt unfolding itself within me.</p>

<p>And there I met this tree,</p>

<p>Like some primordial man, surviving antiquity,</p>

<p>And I embraced it, clasping its trunk in my arms.</p>

<p>For it was there before I was born and will be there
when we are here no longer,</p>

<p>And the measure of its time is not the same as ours.</p>

<p>How many an afternoon I have passed beneath its
shadow, having quieted the clamor of my thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: And what has it taught you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Now, in this hour of anguish! Now I must find
it again!</p>

<p class="indic">(They come to the foot of a huge tree.</p>

<p>O tree, receive me again! Alone I left the protection
of your branches. And now it is alone that I return,
O immovable father!</p>

<p>Take me once more beneath your shadow, O son of
the Earth! O wood, in this hour of sorrow! O
murmuring branches, impart to me</p>

<p>That message which I am and of which I feel within
me the terrible striving.</p>

<p>For you yourself are only a ceaseless striving, the unwearied
drawing of your body out of inanimate
matter.</p>

<p>How you suck the earth, old tree,</p>

<p>Thrusting down, stretching out in every direction your
strong and subtile roots! And the sky, how you
cling to it! How your whole being breathes it in
through one great leaf, Form of Flame!</p>

<p>The inexhaustible earth in the grasp of all the roots of
your being</p>

<p>And the infinite sky, with the sun, with the stars in
their constellations,</p>

<p>Of which you lay hold with that mouth made of all
your arms, with the cluster of your branches, with
the clutch of all there is in you that breathes.</p>

<p>All the earth and all the sky, these are what you require
that you may hold yourself erect!</p>

<p>Let me also hold myself erect! Let me not lose my
soul! That essential sap, that innermost secretion
of my ego, that effervescence</p>

<p>Which constitutes my true self, oh let me not squander
that to make a useless tuft of leaves and flowers!
Let me grow in my unity! Let me remain unique
and erect!</p>

<p>But it was not to hear your murmuring that I came,
O branches that now are bare mid the air opaque and
nebulous!</p>

<p>But it is you that I would question, deep-reaching roots
and that primal depth of the earth where you are
nourished.</p>

<p class="indic">(He stands beneath the tree.&mdash;Pause of indefinite
duration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>sighing, like one awakening from a dream</i>): Let
us go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: O Simon, you will not leave me so!</p>

knowledge?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Nothing that I can tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Well, the thing that you cannot tell, that is what
I demand.</p>

<p>Oh, if indeed</p>

<p>Some law is graven on your heart, if some commandment</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: A spirit has breathed upon me and I vibrate
like a post.</p>

<p>&mdash;Cébès, a force has been given to me, stark, savage!
It is the fury of the male. There is no woman in me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: I implore you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Do not hope to know more than I wish to tell
you.</p>

you go! Was I not there?</p>

<p>Surely to-day I must ask and you must answer!</p>

<p>You shall not go before</p>

<p>You have given me the portion that is due me.</p>

<p>Reply or I will throw myself upon you and constrain
you by force!</p>

<p>I implore you!</p>

<p>You have robbed me of the light of my eyes! You
have carried away my hope and my joy!</p>

<p>You have taken from me the woman I love and brought
her to her death! So now it is to you that I make
my cry!</p>

<p>I charge you by the woman we both have loved,</p>

<p>And by the pity, greater than that of a father for his
child,</p>

<p>Which you must feel for me who am the image of
yourself.</p>

<p>Do not leave me to languish in the depths in which I
lie!</p>

<p>O father, O father, for am I not now your child,</p>

<p>By all that I lack, I beseech you!</p>

<p>See, I will not let go your hands,</p>

<p>And as did that woman when she died, I will hold them
close against my cheek, thus,</p>

<p>Until you have answered me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: I could stay here the whole night through, not
stirring from this place,</p>

<p>And I would not say a word and those who passed
would not see me.</p>

<p>I am here alone and the multitude of men is about me
on every hand, in the fields or in the houses that
they have made, beside the lamps that they have
lighted.</p>

the words that have been taught me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Love me! Understand me! Swear that you
will be loyal and put yourself wholly in my hands.</p>

<p>O death, O night, there are here two guilty persons,
who have found each other.</p>

<p>You lay your hand on my blouse and that which you
touch is still yourself.</p>

<p>It is also I and I am only a man!</p>

<p>Understand me! With your hands lay hold upon this
sorrow! The irresolute man bereft of knowledge!</p>

<p>How fine a thing it is that these lips should say "I."</p>

<p>Yet my eyes, those consuls that should always be vigilant,</p>

<p>Close, and he who is standing must take good heed lest
he fall.</p>

<p>All things change. I must be strong and resist! I
have been a wandering fire, I must rise like a rooted
flame!</p>

<p>Do not leave me alone! Trust in me! Tell me I have
the power!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Hope!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: Yes, I can do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Here I, the first, salute you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: You have knelt before me, alas!</p>

<p>Yet honor me, since thus we have encountered, since
we are here together.</p>

<p>Stay, and that I may serve you as an altar,</p>

<p>Draw near and lay your head against my side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: I give you my prayer and my salutation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Ah!</p>

<p>What is this that drips on my head!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>: It is my blood; thus man, though he has no
breasts, knows how to pour forth his milk!</p>

<p>And now, O Cébès,</p>

<p>You are like a servant who before he departs</p>

<p>Clasps to his breast the cross,</p>

<p>But that crucified thing with its lips of granite draws
towards heaven a band of briars,</p>

<p>And a robin is singing on its ruined shoulder.</p>

<p>Receive my blood upon you! Oh, I will stab myself
to the heart that my blood may burst forth like a
fountain, as you drive in the bung of a cask with a
resolute blow!</p>

<p>It is my blood. Thus do we greet each other, you and
I, we who walk through the shades with warm blood
in our veins.</p>

<p>Like two brothers who, after death, recognise one
another in the eternal night, although they cannot
see</p>

<p>And throw themselves into each others' arms, the tears
streaming down their cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: I salute you, O King!</p>

acts with unconquerable power, according to its
nature!</p>

<p>I also will do my work. Creeping beneath it I will
cause the great stone to tremble!</p>

<p>And with a blow I will take the burden upon me, as a
butcher takes on his back a side of beef!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The King</span>: Sire! Is there still such a title? Do not
call me Sire, my child!</p>

<p>They have left us all alone, my daughter and me, and
everyone has fled, for the enemy is at hand.</p>

<p>They did not trouble themselves much about me.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister did it all. He explained to me
how matters stood. He was always making me late
to dinner. I have a bad digestion; I ought to have
my meals at regular hours.</p>

<p>They held a meeting, some ten or twelve of them, and
they brought a great pile of papers. One sees
strange people nowadays.</p>

<p>Then they all went away. The Prime Minister went
away also, taking with him the crown jewels to put
them in safe keeping.</p>

<p>Even the servants have gone. Not a single one is left.</p>

<p class="indic">(The bells begin to chime midnight.</p>

<p>It is as it is in the city. Only the poor remain and
those who have no choice.</p>

<p>But I cannot sleep and I wander through the palace</p>

<p>From the kitchen to the immense garrets and I seem to
hear behind the doors the quiet breathing of sleepers,
and the fire upon the hearth sends out a little
glow.</p>

<p>These poor folk who arrived yesterday, seeing the palace
empty, asked if they might spend the night here.
They are visionaries; they wish to watch and pray.</p>

<p>It seems that we have been beaten everywhere. It is
a shameful thing!</p>

<p>Our blunders</p>

<p>Surpass our misfortunes, and all is submerged in dishonor.
And at will the enemy crosses our frontiers.</p>

<p>&mdash;Terror is upon us!</p>

<p class="indic">(Silence.&mdash;The snores of the <span class="smcap">watchers</span> are
heard.</p>

devastated, plundered like an unguarded
sheep-fold!</p>

<p>Oh! oh!</p>

<p>Will this terrible night never end!</p>

<p>Sight was horrible to me; I went to bed. O Sleep,</p>

<p>Kill me with your leaden dart!</p>

<p>But I cannot sleep and I open my eyes again in the
black Nothingness.</p>

<p>It has no knowledge nor any real existence</p>

<p>But the gloom takes weight and stiflingly presses upon
us.</p>

<p>Oh! oh!</p>

<p>I shudder from head to foot and I cry aloud in my
anguish!</p>

<p>And I leap out of bed and run hither and thither, striking
my head against the walls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: How far away is the enemy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The King</span>: Not more than a day's march.</p>

<p>I think the battle must have already been fought.</p>

<p>&mdash;Still five hours till dawn! We shall see. Very soon
we shall know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The King</span>: How pale you are, my poor boy! You are
very ill. Tête-d'or</p>

lad.</p>

<p>I look at you! I wish to contemplate</p>

<p>A thing still young, as I myself have been,</p>

<p>And the dawning of power in astonished eyes!</p>

<p>The young man sleeps very tranquilly. He dreams,
and in his dream is the morning sun.</p>

<p>The evening has been glorious, a golden day awaits
him.</p>

<p>I also have been young. I have been a young man also,</p>

<p>And I have been a little, little child. Now I have
lived three score and fifteen years, and I am old

<p>And this is what I am, and this is what I see!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: I shall be the first to die.</p>

<p>I have not strength enough to rise and walk.</p>

<p>Yes! What a thing it is to live!</p>

<p>What an astonishing thing it is</p>

<p>Only to live! What a mighty thing it is, only to live!</p>

<p>He who lives</p>

<p>And treads the earth under his feet, what does he envy
the gods?</p>

<p>I die,</p>

no rest.</p>

<p>He pants and perhaps he wishes to rest. But his work
is alive under him and it does not wish to stop. And
he has become its slave, for he is snared by the feet</p>

his eyes away.</p>

<p class="indic">(The <i>princess</i> re-enters. She wears a red robe
and a golden mantle that covers her from
head to foot. On her head is a sort of mitre
and a thick black braid is thrown across her
shoulders. She comes forward, her eyes
closed, moving rhythmically and very slowly,
and stops at the edge of the lamplight. All
look at her in silence and with great attention.</p>

<p class="indic">Pause.</p>

<p class="indic">One of the bystanders rises and, taking the
lamp, he holds it close to the face of the
<span class="smcap">princess</span> and examines it. Then he replaces
the lamp on the floor and returns to his place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Watcher</span> (<i>breaking the silence</i>): Who is
there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second Watcher</span>: Hush! Listen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span> (<i>in a low voice, opening her eyes for an
instant</i>): One with closed eyes who is about to
awaken from a long sleep.</p>

<p class="indic">(She closes her eyes again.&mdash;Silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: What did I say of the sun?</p>

<p>Here in this room there is another sun who gazes upon
us in his splendor!</p>

<p>Who is this, clothed in such a garment, with hands
hidden beneath a tissue of gold?</p>

<p>Who is this, of the height of a human being,</p>

<p>Who stands in a flowing robe between the lamp and
the dark?</p>

<p>Turn towards us and hold your face before us!</p>

<p>Ahhh!</p>

<p>Our unworthiness is bodily present among us! There
is not one of us who can escape it! Beautiful and
blind,</p>

<p>Do not reopen your eyes! Let us feast on your loveliness</p>

<p>Now that you do not look at us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span> (<i>sighing</i>): Nnn!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Watcher</span> (<i>half-aloud</i>): What does that
mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second Watcher</span>: Do you not understand?</p>

<p class="indic">(Pantomime. The <span class="smcap">princess</span> seems to be
awakening from sleep, with slow gestures
and eyes always closed.</p>

<p>Look!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span> (<i>sighing again</i>): No! ah!</p>

<p class="indic">(She slowly shakes her head. Then remains
motionless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: Will you awake?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span> (<i>very softly</i>): Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: Come, make an end, if those
eyelids still are faithful to one another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: Ah!</p>

<p>Must I leave you, lovely land?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Watcher</span>: What land?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: "I sleep" it is called.</p>

<p>I have fled from life, I am dancing in a dream,</p>

<p>My feet are set among strawberry blossoms and lilies
of the valley.</p>

<p>I cannot move from my place.</p>

<p>A dull voice says, "Come!" A clear voice says, "Go!"
But I cannot move from my place.</p>

<p class="indic">(She opens her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: Look and see! Alas, you
have ceased to smile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span> (<i>stretching out both arms and pointing to
the bystanders</i>): Who are these?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: Living men, and I am one
also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: And why do they stay here, seated on
the floor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: It is night, and there is no
light while it endures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: And what is that lamp?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: <i>Lampas est expectationis.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: And for what are they waiting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: For Death, who is on the
way, and the door is open for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: And what dwelling is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: It is the house of the King.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: And why have they placed the lamp
upon the floor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: I will tell you that. It is so
that they can see it.</p>

<p class="indic">(Short pause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Watcher</span>: And who are you that question
us?</p>

<p class="indic">(Short pause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: I do not know. Indeed I do not know
who I am!</p>

<p>And you, do you not know? Oh, who among you will
tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Third Watcher</span>: <i>Gaudium nostrum es et dilectio,
et jussimus te valere.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: Truly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second Watcher</span>: Have you come again, O
woman?</p>

<p>Your absence has been long, but I have not forgotten,
and often I dreamed of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: Then you have known me before?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second Watcher</span>: Ask me no questions, for I
am a surly man.</p>

<p class="indic">(Pause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span> (<i>looks pensively from one to another.
They lower their eyes</i>): I see more clearly now.
I see you all. Surely the darkness shall not hide you
nor the light of the lamp.</p>

<p>It is I. What do you want of me?</p>

<p>You dreamed of me, you say? Well, I am here.</p>

<p>&mdash;Why do you keep your eyes lowered? Are you
afraid to look at me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Third Watcher</span>: There is nothing that we want,</p>

<p>O woman, and we do not ask you for anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span> (<i>looking at him</i>): So it is you. I
know you now. (<i>She turns towards the</i> <span class="smcap">first

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span> (<i>rising hurriedly</i>): Make way!
Let me go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span> (<i>stretching her hand towards him</i>): Stay!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: I understand only your
beauty! It is all a play but why does she turn herself
towards us</p>

<p>With the face of bygone things and of regret,</p>

<p>Alas! and things that were never to be? I remember
the sweetness of love! Do not shame me before
these men!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: Shame? And I myself, can I not be
ashamed before them,</p>

<p>Like a wise and modest man who stands erect amidst
drunkards?</p>

<p>Ah! Ah! I see and I know! Alas! I see! I see and
I understand!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: We salute you, O beauty!
We salute you, reproach!</p>

<p>O Notary of the dying, now you are drawing near us
bearing your book and scroll.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: Truly, I pity you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: Be sad, for we are sad.</p>

<p class="indic">(The nightingale sings again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: I am not sad! The nightingale sings
and I will also sing! Let him sing and I will sing
also!</p>

<p>And my voice shall be uplifted like the piping of a flute,</p>

<p>Higher, louder, enfolding the city and the night.</p>

<p>I will sing and cast away all bounds and all restraint!</p>

<p>The bird sings in the summer and is silent in the winter,
but I will sing in the chill and bitter air, and when
all is frozen I will rise, drunk with ecstasy, towards
the naked heavens!</p>

<p>For my voice is that of love and in my heart is the fire
of youth.</p>

<p class="indic">(She opens her mouth as if about to sing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: Be silent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: You do not wish me to sing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: Be silent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: Then I will talk to you and will not
sing....</p>

<p>Did you think I had gone away? In truth I was always
with you.</p>

<p>And I will not tell you who I am, for you know it and
do not forget.</p>

<p>Every woman is only a mother. I am she who rears
and nourishes,</p>

<p>And entreating you for yourselves in the sacred name
of pity,</p>

<p>Receive from you for her portion</p>

<p>A boundless labor hard to undertake! But because I
do not speak with your speech you despise me.</p>

<p>And you did not think to see me; but at last I have
shown myself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Third Watcher</span>: Is it you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span> (<i>after silently contemplating them</i>): O
fools!</p>

<p>Fools! What shall I say? What shall I leave unsaid?
Did you believe that you could hide from me? I penetrate
to the bottom of your souls. Nothing is hidden
in obscuring shadow.</p>

<p>And you will not always be able</p>

<p>To steal away from me like a thief of the night.</p>

<p>What have you done? How have you fled from me?</p>

<p>I could call to each of you</p>

<p>By his name and summon him to stand and face me,
And one by one I could recount his acts,</p>

<p>Showing his deeds of folly and how he had sinned</p>

<p>Through his own fault and not the fault of another,</p>

<p>So that before me he would be like a man who gives
himself up for lost.</p>

<p>O presumptuous fool! O vile and brazen companion!
O horrible and ridiculous violence!</p>

<p>You have rebuffed me and have thrust me forth, but
to-day I shall call you to account and you shall answer
me!</p>

<p>I shall call you to account with a sharp and piercing
voice, and it shall pass through your heart like a
sword!</p>

<p>And I shall be harder and more bitter to you than a
shrew to her husband!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: What could we do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Third Watcher</span>: Shall we shriek before you like
mandrakes? Shall we cause the moon to tremble
with our cries, more dreadful than the shrieks of
the murderer caught in the clutches of the law?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Watcher</span>: With what does she reproach
us?</p>

<p>She is a woman. Have we not known</p>

<p>Women like her? And have we not found them nothing
and less than nothing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: And was I then so ugly,</p>

<p>So far from pleasing that no one of you would have
looked with favor upon me, and followed after me,
and taken me for his mistress?</p>

<p>What have you done for me? And yet what is there
that I could not give you?</p>

<p>Sometimes the Muse descends to wander the ways of
earth,</p>

<p>And profiting by the evening hour when the townspeople
sit at supper,</p>

<p>Passes by, with laurel wreathing her brow; walks, barefoot,
beside the flowing stream, singing immortal
verses</p>

<p>All alone like a solitary stag.</p>

<p>And I, though I love that calm retreat,</p>

<p>Cannot always remain in the fountains and caves and
deserted hollows among the oaks,</p>

<p>But I cry, at the cross-roads, and in the city streets,</p>

<p>In the bustling market-place and by the doors of the
dance halls,</p>

<p>"Who will barter handfuls of blackberries for handfuls
of heavy gold and give the flesh of his heart in
exchange for a lasting love?"</p>

<p class="indic">(She goes to each of the bystanders and, forcing
him to raise his head and seizing it by the
hair and the chin, she looks in his face, her
eyes close to his. Then she resumes her
former position in silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: Save our souls for us if you
have the power!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: From this time forth we are strangers!</p>

<p>Let the shadows and the lamp bear witness to our divorce!</p>

<p>Many a time in such dim shades, I have warned you
earnestly. But you would give no heed.</p>

<p>Here in this murky light,</p>

<p>Now that your souls are numbered with those that are
marked for death, I come to you once more</p>

<p>Not to repair the breach, but to proclaim it!</p>

<p>You invoke me at a moment when you are beyond all
aid!</p>

<p>What have you made of me?</p>

<p>It is most fitting that you should taste of death!</p>

<p>But as for me, I suffer an iniquitous punishment and
am a reproach to you</p>

<p>Unavailingly!</p>

<p>Alas that I should have met so much stubbornness and
ignorance!</p>

<p>Alas, I could cry aloud in my grief and if you could
not endure</p>

<p>To hear the cries of your wife in the agony of her
travail, how could you bear to hear my grievances
against you?</p>

<p>Oh! It is late! And I</p>

<p>Must go away alone like a widow harshly evicted from
her home!</p>

<p>You will think of me with regret in the hour of your
agony,</p>

<p>But I abandon you and leave this dwelling. And may
the spiders weave their webs here!</p>

beard,</p>

<p>And fixing blood-shot eyes on the ground! Let me go,
I beg of you!</p>

Nevertheless let him sleep his sleep;</p>

those successive lines, those strong columns that,
marching like one man, advanced across the valleys
and the plains, that interminable line of cannon....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The King</span>: O my children!</p>

<p>I cannot speak,</p>

<p>For an hour better than I have deserved</p>

<p>Has come upon me,</p>

<p>On me, the incapable, useless governor of this country!</p>

<p>O Messenger, you have restored their taste to bread
and wine.</p>

<p>Let the bells ring out till all the air resounds,</p>

<p>Let the round brazen throats beneath the bell-ringer's
feet fill with our jubilation,</p>

<p>The circle of the earth and the height of heaven!</p>

<p>Let the singers of our triumph stand forth together,</p>

<p>And let their mouths exhaling</p>

<p>A song of benediction, eat of the sun till evening!</p>

<p>Wine! Wine! I wish to drink with you, O Messenger,</p>

<p>Even as two carters do who meet in a roadside inn!</p>

<p class="indic">(Wine is brought.</p>

<p>O fortune, I drink to you with this trembling hand!
Accept this toast!</p>

<p>O fortune, since you have given us this hour, conduct
us where you will! (<i>He drinks.</i>) Excellent glass
of wine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: I cannot</p>

<p>Put wine between my teeth till that excessive joy</p>

<p>Which buoyed me upon my horse as I galloped towards
you</p>

<p>Has spoken.</p>

<p>I say that the kingdom has been saved by handfuls of
gold and jewels!</p>

<p>He was not ashamed to beg, on the bridges, at the
cross-roads,</p>

<p>Stretching out his princely hands,</p>

<p>Burying in the mud his armored knees....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Third Watcher</span>: We have seen him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: ... Fixing before him his sparkling
eyes, like an Andromeda with horse's mane,
more proud than the god of the wind when at the
water's edge</p>

<p>He kneels, stretching out his hands to the chains on
the rocks of Occismor,</p>

<p>Till he was buried up to the thighs in alms!</p>

<p>For each man looked at him with astonishment, and
struck with a vague shame, he gave in silence all that
he had and placed it on the ground before him.</p>

<p>He had come, our king, unique in his beauty, adorned
with marvellous deeds!</p>

<p>And, full of a secret sadness, we recalled his face, shy
and terrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Watcher</span>: It is thus that....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: If anyone dared to speak to him, unaddressed,
saying, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>He looked at him a moment, and answered, "I am
what I seem to be. You are not mistaken."</p>

<p>"Oh!" one said to him, "Oh, war!</p>

<p>When shall we have peace?"</p>

<p>"You wish to live in peace?"</p>

<p>"Surely," he answered, "Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"Coward, you cannot! Even now they come to rob
you of your goods</p>

<p>And the man is at hand who will take you, caught by
the scruff of the neck, and geld you like a domestic
animal."</p>

<p>And the questioner said, "What can I do?"</p>

<p>"Fight!" he answered, "Resist!"</p>

<p>"And conquer also, perhaps?" "You can do it," he
replied and he looked at him fixedly.</p>

<p>"O man insulted and outraged,</p>

<p>To-day you can wash away your shame and rise from
your baseness and give the lie to the name they have
bestowed upon you!"</p>

<p>These words were repeated and often he who heard
them</p>

<p>Did not forget them, but, leaving his wife alone in her
bed to weep,</p>

<p>He paced all night the floor of his room, pondering
this question,</p>

<p>"If I try, why cannot I?"</p>

<p>Until a little phrase, full of a sense of strength,</p>

<p>Impinged upon his consciousness: "I can!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Watcher</span>: It is astonishing! It is utterly
astonishing! I did not believe what they told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: Then it was</p>

<p>That in the unhappy soul was born the fury of the
captive!</p>

<p>Renouncing life and crying "Forward!", they flocked
to where the bugle sounded the assembly.</p>

<p>Still not sure of themselves,</p>

<p>When, like a superintendent among his workmen, he
walked among them, looking at them all, assuring
himself</p>

<p>That everything was according to his command.</p>

<p>They turned to him their ranks of eyes of every kind
and hue, and they were comforted again.</p>

<p>To a man they gladly left their families and their
work.</p>

<p>There was on the slope a mighty growth of broom,
tree of yellow flowers, dear to the bees.</p>

<p>He had it cut down and, having kissed it, he bade them
bear it before him. Then he mounted his horse.</p>

<p>And the soldiers waiting their turn to set out,</p>

<p>Heard behind them the rustling of the flag, cock of the
war, song of sails!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span>: Come! Speak! Speak!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: But when they came to the field
where they had to die or conquer,</p>

<p>They knew another flag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Watcher</span>: What flag?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: What flag? Not a tatter of silk, not
a woman's shirt that a child waves about on the end
of a bean-pole!</p>

<p>But like some old gibbet that creaks beneath its burden
of corpses, like a mast with its sinister yardarms,</p>

<p>The monstrous standard of our wretchedness, enormous,
charged with chains!</p>

<p>They saw it while they set their feet on a soil enriched
by the flesh</p>

<p>Of their fathers and mothers, like fallen leaves!</p>

<p>At first they kept their ranks, fighting shoulder to
shoulder, and thus it was for some time.</p>

<p>But finally full of a rage like the lust for gold,</p>

<p>They rushed forward all together, raising discordant
cries.</p>

<p>And then a sudden panic</p>

<p>Arose as if all at once, though it was day, the Night</p>

<p>Rearing up her giant head with its diadem of stars,</p>

<p>Confounded the sense with the blast of her prodigious
horn.</p>

<p>They were astounded, those others, and they trembled,
and suddenly the serried ranks of our foes,</p>

<p>Like colts stampeded by a clanking chain,</p>

<p>Turned tail and fled!</p>

<p>Thus did we raise that army, having gotten under it,</p>

<p>Thus did we tilt it backward like a cask,</p>

<p>Spilling a great tumult of men</p>

<p>On the earth and in the reedy beds of streams.</p>

<p>Think of it! That innumerable horde turned their
backs, and ran before us! Zounds!</p>

<p>Oh who has seen such a massacre, the piles of wounded
and dying</p>

<p>Gasping like a catch of fish in the bottom of a boat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span>: Triumph!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: Sharp cries resounded on the bleeding
air, and the mad galloping of horsemen, and
cannon whose flashes glared through the pall of
smoke!</p>

<p>God!</p>

<p>We chased them with a shoe like rats!</p>

<p>Doddering gray beards with a gesture</p>

<p>Put to flight battalions, and children whose voices
broke,</p>

<p>Catching him by the bridle, led away the horse and his
rider.</p>

<p>This I saw.</p>

<p>I saw the captured flags brought in like fagots!</p>

<p>I remember soldiers, black-bearded, or with chins</p>

<p>Bristling with white hairs,</p>

<p>Who in the evening, while the soup was cooking,</p>

<p>Stood, their feet in the heather, like smiths worn out
with toil,</p>

<p>Red like the arbute-berry in the ruddy gloaming,</p>

<p>Contemplating through the branches the scarlet sky
from which comes life.</p>

<p>&mdash;As for him,</p>

<p>Those who stood by his stirrups, taking his orders,</p>

<p>Listening with parted lips to what he said, for the first
time saw on his face,</p>

<p>Like that of a man who, in the midst of a crowd, mocks
at an absurd misfortune,</p>

<p>The inconstant smile of a young girl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span>: Triumph! Triumph!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: Now let these eyes which have seen
such a spectacle</p>

<p>Cover themselves with a film, and let this vase</p>

<p>That has contained such an image dash itself to
pieces!</p>

<p>To think that I, I should have lived to see such a day!</p>

<p>Rejoice! Victory whinnying like a virgin mare</p>

<p>Rolls on the battlefield,</p>

<p>Lashing out with shining hooves, turning her trout's
belly to the sky!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: O messenger!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: Who calls me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Is that all that Tête-d'or said to you? Won't
he be coming soon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: Are you he whom he calls Cébès?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: In that case, Tête-d'or gave me a
message for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: What? Did he think of me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: He told me to say that he will soon
be here. Listen, all of you!</p>

<p>These are his words, "Say that I shall be there.</p>

<p>I am coming, I myself."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: He is coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: He is hard upon my heels.</p>

<p class="indic">(Trumpet without.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Watcher</span>: Hark!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Third Watcher</span>: I hear the voice of the trumpet.</p>

<p class="indic">(Pause. Noise of arms without.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Watcher</span>: He is here.</p>

<p class="indic">(<span class="smcap">tête-d'or</span> enters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The King</span> (<i>advancing to meet him</i>): You have preserved
this kingdom,</p>

<p>The men that work, the women that bear children, and
the fields that yield food.</p>

<p>You have given a second birth to everything.</p>

<p>Young man, I greet you with the name of Father.</p>

<p>May blessings gather on your beloved head.</p>

<p>Enter, conquering hero,</p>

<p>Welcome to this hearth and to this shadowy hall almost
bereft of light,</p>

<p>And first I salute you as is fitting.</p>

<p class="indic">(He hows before him.</p>

<p class="indic">(All come and one after the other bow before him.</p>

<p>Hail!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: I thank you, Sire.</p>

<p>I thank you all. Who am I? What have I done?</p>

<p>That which must be already exists. From whom is
this knowledge hidden?</p>

<p>(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">cébès</span>) And you, will you not give me a word of
welcome, thus happily returned?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: O Tête-d'or!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Find an excuse! Pretend that you still are
sick!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Stay here with me. I want to talk to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: He wants to talk to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The King</span>: Do you wish us to withdraw?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Do this for me.</p>

<p>Do this for me, my friends! I ask your pardon.</p>

<p>You shall hear what I have to say to you presently.</p>

<p class="indic">(They all go out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Well, Cébès, here I am! The same as
ever!</p>

<p>I come again, having conquered!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: By these victorious hands, dear friend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Give me a brotherly welcome.</p>

<p class="indic">(They embrace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: O man with the power to conquer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: I bayed at their heels! I made them rise
from the dung in which they sat.</p>

<p>Then I saw that what I wished for was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: But how?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: I am telling you! I was more firm on my
horse than on a rock.</p>

<p>&mdash;But I wanted to talk with you and there you are still
in your bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Do not pity me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Are you feeling better?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Because I am not worth your trouble, hero!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: You do not render me a true account.</p>

<p>Am I not your tutor? Do you think that all I have
done can go for naught? Was it in vain, that adoption
that bound us so close together on that night
of sorrow?</p>

<p>And are you not mine?</p>

<p class="indic">(Silence.</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: You twist the chain of my sword but do not
speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Tête-d'or....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Well?</p>

<p class="indic">(Silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Did you bring back your army with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Yes, it is close behind me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: You have gained the victory! You knew how
to command all these men according to their corps
and their battalion, and they obeyed you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Yes, for I saw and knew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: My opportunity and how to seize it.</p>

<p>The eyes and the brain cry at the selfsame instant:</p>

<p>"This thing must be!" I take that which is due me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: And I, I do not see and do not know!</p>

<p>What could I have done?</p>

<p>Yet I am wise though in one thing only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Which is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Will it bore you if I tell you everything? Or
shall I speak freely</p>

<p>As to the man in whom</p>

<p>I have put my trust?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: In what thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span> (<i>very low</i>): To give</p>

<p>Myself.</p>

<p>But to give myself to whom? Not</p>

<p>To one as weak as I am.</p>

<p>Nothing imperfect can satisfy me for I do not satisfy
myself.</p>

<p>So I seek a man who is perfectly just and true,</p>

<p>That he may be perfectly good and I may love him.</p>

<p>I am only a child, Tête-d'or, but I tell you I have
within me</p>

<p>A thing older than I,</p>

<p>And it has its own secret source and seeks its own end,
in spite of my sodden intellect and unsure senses,
and it makes my life bitter.</p>

<p>But I open my eyes and see the sun as it rises and sets,</p>

<p>And nature, and I find no happiness there. And I see
other men and they are like myself.</p>

<p>To which of them shall I speak? I shall speak to him
and he will make reply.</p>

<p>Each cries, "Like us you must pay for the right to be
alive!" But as I say I have no handicraft,</p>

<p>I can only pay with myself.</p>

<p>And all men are full of faults,</p>

<p>&mdash;But you, do you think that such a man exists?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: You lay your hand on an old wound!&mdash;He
exists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: He exists then.</p>

<p>But which of us speaks and is not understood?</p>

<p>Has he rejected me, or am I in any way to blame?</p>

<p>I bear witness to the Truth</p>

<p>That there is nothing here I am not ready to leave
behind as one rises from a chair.</p>

<p>But I see a fly, a plant, a stone, yet him I do not see.</p>

<p>And if I do not find him why have my eyes been dowered
with the faculty of seeing, and my hands with
fingers as if they saw!</p>

<p>For I raise my hands and move them here and there!</p>

<p>And will someone speak of self-control and of works
of betterment by which the noble man consecrates
himself like a temple?</p>

<p>I do not care to be loved. But I know how to love
and I would see and have!</p>

<p>And against these sure desires there is only a vague
perhaps.</p>

<p>And why will it later be otherwise? For I am made
of flesh and blood, as my mother made me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: What is it? You look at me strangely and
there is something in you that I do not recognise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: You have come, O Conqueror,</p>

<p>To all the rest like the promise of a future of happy
days!</p>

<p>For me alone you bring no rescue!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span> (<i>lying down again</i>): I am dying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: What did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: What the doctors told me, and it is the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: I shall not live through another night. I shall
not live till noon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: No! No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: It is not the pain that I fear, and the cramps,
and the horrible struggle to vomit,</p>

<p>When my mouth is filled with bile and blood and the
sweat pours out of my body like water from a
sponge.</p>

<p>This I can bear, for my heart is stout, and I shall look
in your face, my brother, in the hour of my torture.</p>

<p>Why was I born? For I die and then I shall exist no
more.</p>

<p>The shadows had closed about me so that I slept in
darkness and woke in darkness. And I saw nothing;
and I was deaf and heard no sound.</p>

<p>For I am like a man buried alive, and I am confined as
in an oven!</p>

<p>Give me light! Give me light! Give me light! Give
me light! For I would see!</p>

<p>Give me air, for I stifle!</p>

<p>Give me to drink, for I do not want the water that
they bring me.</p>

<p>But you, give me water to drink, that I may die in
peace, for I am consumed with thirst!</p>

<p>O brother! I have put my trust in you! Will you not
help me? I beg you, soldier, head of gold, O my
bright-haired brother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Oh! That I could do as does the eagle,</p>

<p>Who, letting fall a useless prey, perishes in his ravaged
eyrie!</p>

<p>Why did you cross my path?</p>

<p>Why, like pride, having kneeled before me, did you
clasp me in your arms like a tree or a fountain?</p>

<p>On my heart, he pressed his face against this throbbing
regret!</p>

<p>And again he asks my help in the hour of his death!</p>

<p>I do not understand! I have done my best</p>

<p>And I have turned my steps towards that house of sin,</p>

<p>And I thought that, having renounced all selfish hope,</p>

<p>To-day I would work with my hands.</p>

<p>You speak of desire, the necessity of the present hour
constrains me!</p>

<p>The rapacious desire drags me forward through this
place of horror.</p>

<p>And he asks, and I cannot reply to this poor luckless
child, and he is dying before my eyes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: You weep? Is that your only answer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: I beg you</p>

<p>To leave me alone and not to question me. What do
you want of me? Shall I hide you in my belly and
give birth to you again?</p>

<p>It is most horrible</p>

<p>That you should draw these woman's tear-drops from
me.</p>

<p>You question me and, like a brutish thing,</p>

<p>I can reply only by these vain waters!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: You shall not escape me thus. Answer and I
will question you. For you are my teacher and must
answer me.</p>

<p>Answer! When a man dies does something still survive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Be still, and try me no more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Answer! Is there an end of the personality?
For as for the bodily form we know that it disappears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: I answer that man has been conceived according
to the flesh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: And to die is not to escape?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: This world was made for man and a limit
was set about him,</p>

<p>That he might not escape and that no one might enter
in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Then I shall die and shall no longer exist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: I will tell you what I know when I do not
know it.</p>

<p>And my answer is silence, and the breath that blows
from the open and black abyss.</p>

<p>You did not breathe in the days when you lay in the
womb of your mother,</p>

<p>But her blood entered into your body and flowed in
you and your heart was moored to her heart through
the middle of your belly,</p>

<p>And having come out of her you breathed and uttered
a cry!</p>

<p>I also have uttered a cry,</p>

<p>A cry like a babe new-born, and I have drawn the keen
and burning sword, and have beheld</p>

<p>Humanity divide before me like the separation of the
waters!</p>

<p>And now I return to you and find you in the lassitude
of death!</p>

<p>Must everyone that I love die and leave me alone?</p>

<p>Must you wither in my hands like a flower of the
stream before I had asked "Who are you?" and
you had answered me?</p>

<p>Pit of weariness! Horror in which I stand! Is there
someone here?</p>

<p>Is there something stable here? Who will carve a
letter upon the face of the Mountain?</p>

<p>We can eat; we can lay a dish before ourselves and
feed;</p>

<p>But the gravel sets our teeth on edge and ever from
our eyes there flow invisible tears.</p>

<p>Then go to the common home! And now I say to you,</p>

<p>Hope not to still survive, being dead,</p>

<p>For how can any man see without his eyes, and how
else will he be able</p>

<p>A bitter indignation boils within me!</p>

<p>My bowels bloat! I am racked with fearful retchings</p>

<p>That strive to rive apart the fastening of my bones!</p>

<p>Alone I die! And I pant in vain for breath and there

Pause.</p>

<p>Tête-d'or, there are many kinds of men, the weak and
the strong, the sick and the well.</p>

<p>I pity them; the incompetent and the stammering, the
poor of spirit and those that ask for alms</p>

<p>With the deprecating smile that masks the shudder of
shame behind.</p>

<p>And those that are mocked and cannot make reply,
and cowards,</p>

<p>And those who from the darkness of their souls exhale
a prayer devoid of savor!</p>

<p>And you, do you not also pity me?</p>

<p>And I say to you like that woman</p>

<p>When she lay at the roadside in the shadow of death;</p>

<p>"Why do you let me die?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Take me with you if you wish! Do you
think that I am not weary?</p>

<p>Groaning, I strove to tear myself from those strong
and bony hands.</p>

<p>And now you weep and would bring me again to that
terrible repose!</p>

<p>The wind ruffles my hair and the heartbreak of the
earth lies stark and bare before my despairing eyes!
And I look and am filled with shame!</p>

<p>O the fate of the bee and the fly whose life lasts only
a season and endures but a single day!</p>

<p>And the birds of the wood are also alive; and the
caterpillar that crawls on the leaf and the broom
that roots in the sand,</p>

<p>And the ravening beast and the thistle with purple
flowers!</p>

<p>And you, who are dying, you counsel me to die!</p>

<p>I cannot loose my limbs from these tough ligatures!</p>

<p>O world! O self! O shameful destiny!</p>

<p>Let me be iron and like a thing of wood!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: What hope....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: I look at you and is it thus you lie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Come, let's not talk of it. Things are better
than you think. But, tell me....</p>

<p>I do not understand ... you follow me ... eh?
What inner pride, what secret flame....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Neither do I, I do not understand! I am
tired!</p>

<p>You speak of hidden things that the thick tongue
shudders to say,</p>

<p>Tales with no basis of reason, blood that flows like
saliva!</p>

<p>A little word of consolation watches beneath all
wretchedness,</p>

<p>Sweet forget-me-not of fire that lights us mournfully
with its faithful gleam!</p>

<p>&mdash;Beyond the silence a voice like the human voice</p>

like coffee!</p>

<p>O glowing geranium! O clot of sunlight! It throbs!
It bleeds like a fragment of living flesh!</p>

<p>I beg of you, do not ask me anything more!</p>

<p>I, I have something to tell to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: It has not been permitted that I should die in
such despair! And now I am beyond all pain,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: What, brother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Take me in your arms and hold me, for there
is no longer any strength in me. And put me on
your shoulder like an armful of leafy branches.</p>

<p>O Tête-d'or! you have baptised me with your blood.
Now like a babe I lie upon your breast and pour
forth on your bosom all myself,</p>

<p>For every tie is dissolved and I am like a severed
branch.</p>

<p class="indic">(<span class="smcap">tête-d'or</span> takes <span class="smcap">cébès</span> in his arms.</p>

<p>That if in the midst of his path through a dreary solitude,</p>

<p>Of a sudden the wanderer halts at the summons of his
heart,</p>

<p>It is love, that locks the man and woman in agonised
embrace.</p>

<p>They do not recognise themselves and the lover feels
a pang like the stab of a knife beneath his ribs,</p>

<p>And invents those phrases that begin with O,</p>

<p>Imitating the piercing cries of sea-birds, for their
silence is like the peace of the waters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: What have you to say to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: O Tête-d'or! I am not a woman and neither
am I a man,</p>

<p>For I am not of age, and I am already as if I were no
more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Who are you then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: O Tête-d'or, all pain is past!</p>

<p>The snare is broken and I am free! I am the plant
that has been uprooted from the earth!</p>

<p>There is a joy that comes with man's last hour. That
joy am I and the secret that can no longer be told.</p>

<p>O Tête-d'or, I give myself to you and deliver myself
into your hands! So hold me while I am with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: O Cébès, whom thus I have taken in my
arms, I will question you in my turn. Hand yearns
to hand</p>

<p>And mouth to mouth, yet never do they meet, for an
invisible barrier lies between.</p>

<p>That is the pang of love through which it is like the
water that boils and disappears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: Then love me more for I scarcely can be called
a living man.</p>

<p>And I am like a bird that one seizes on the wing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: O brother, I have jealously taken from you
the woman you loved. And you would have been
happy with her. But it was destined that your love
should be given to none but me.</p>

<p>Brother! Child!</p>

<p>O all the tenderness of my heart, I have taken you
between my hands!</p>

<p>O burden! O sacrifice that I bear in my arms like a
sheep whose feet are bound together!</p>

<p>Shall I call you my child or my brother? For I am
more mindful of you</p>

<p>Than a father would have been of that pallid little
face. And my heart is attached to yours by a
stronger and sweeter tie</p>

<p>Than that which binds a brother to his little brother
in the nursery when he plays with him in the evening,
and lulls him to sleep with stories and helps
in taking off his shoes.</p>

<p>O my friend that I have found in the gloom, are you
going to abandon me and leave me all alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: O Tête-d'or, as you gave yourself to me</p>

<p>Even so I give myself to you,</p>

<p>And as you did not trust your secret to me,</p>

<p>Neither shall I entrust to you mine.</p>

<p>I am strangely light and like a thing that can no longer
be held.</p>

<p>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</p>

<p>It is the hour when the traveller, huddled among the

<p>Awakes, and peers through the pane, and coughs, and
sighs,</p>

<p>And souls new-born in the shadows of walls and forests,</p>

<p>Fly back again, guided by flaring meteors, into the
regions of obscurity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cébès</span>: It is over!&mdash;And the daybreak that kindles the
sea to flame and with far-reaching fires</p>

is kept and like the breath of the oven when the
door of it is opened,</p>

<p>There lies before us the plenty of the fields.</p>

<p>It is night. The meadow is thick with harvest and
far away one can almost hear</p>

<p>The swish of the scythe in the lush grass.</p>

<p>Already the fires of the routed stars are paling.</p>

<p>He who bursts into tears and whose head is bowed

<p><span class="smcap">The King</span>: O young man, the old man is the man of
the present time.</p>

<p>Respect that which is mine. Respect the possessions
of the father of the family.</p>

<p>This kingdom was made by my fathers and I am its
rightful monarch according to the law of inheritance.</p>

<p>And I am like a man who goes about his estate, saying,
"These trees were planted by my father.</p>

<p>And that broad field</p>

<p>Belonged to his cousin, who died, leaving no children,
and it was gotten after a lengthly lawsuit.</p>

<p>The higher levels are good but nothing will grow on
the flats.</p>

<p>And yonder farm was part of my grandmother's wedding
portion; her marriage is still remembered."</p>

<p>Thus my fathers sat, throned in their wooden armchairs,
ruling honestly, giving ear to the needs of
their people and settling their differences.</p>

<p>And the people held them in reverence although often
they were harsh and unjust and gluttonous and overfond
of women.</p>

<p>And me they have found too old and they have set me
aside, like an old man who remains wherever they
place his chair.</p>

<p>But the creaking of the great door still is dear to my
heart</p>

<p>When it opens wide to receive the carts, piled high with
the harvest, that the horses straining their utmost
can barely draw.</p>

<p>Do not take what is mine; do not despoil my daughter.
For where will be the blessing that you will earn
among men</p>

<p>If you tread the hallowed law of inheritance under
your feet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tête-d'or</span>: Father of the family, I shall not respect
you.</p>

<p>For I am like a first-born son forced from his heritage,
whose place the steward has taken, the son of a
favored slave.</p>

<p>O miserly old man who would keep what you cannot
use,</p>

<p>Slothful monarch, most like the pitiful king of the
chess-board</p>

<p>Shut in by the castle, guarded by pawns, and assaulted
by the knight.</p>

<p>You are the man of the present hour, but already that
hour is over.</p>

<p>Your right, I do not know what it is. But as for me,
despised by all, I have sworn in my misfortune and
in my solitude</p>

<p>By the air and by the earth,</p>

<p>That I would rise above the will of others.</p>

<p>And as for what my right is, listen all!</p>

<p>I did not gain that victory, but a beggar, a man unknown,</p>

you would not wish to kill me nor would you

<p>Do not do it, lest those that love me</p>

<p>Should not accept the excuse that you did not know
who I am and your name should be a thing accursed
forever.</p>

the wall!</p>

<p>&mdash;O light that fills all space! O sun that makes the
day, like a judge considering everything!</p>

<p>See me pinioned thus, and these nails that are buried
up to the head in my hands.</p>

<p>It is morning still and I shall remain till noon,</p>

<p>And till evening and till I am dead.</p>

<p>But this is as it should be and I shall not complain.</p>

<p>I shall die erect</p>

<p>As is most fitting for one of a kingly race.</p>

<p>O hands, I had dreamed that some day I should bring
you both to my husband</p>

<p>That he might bind you with the bonds of wedlock,</p>

<p>But these nails are more suitable.</p>

<p>My blood jets on high and it falls upon my head and
runs down my body!</p>

<p>Ah! Ah!</p>

<p>My arms are heavy as lead!</p>

<p>O God! My feet are free and I can only stamp on
the earth.</p>

<p>And if I remain, resting so on both feet,</p>

<p>I pull on the nails and stifle and suffer intolerable pain!</p>

<p>But if I stand on tiptoe, my strength is soon gone.</p>

<p>O God, have pity on me!</p>

<p class="indic">(Long silence which is supposed, to last many
hours and during which the stage remains empty.</p>

<p class="indic">(Enter from the left the <span class="smcap">standard bearer</span> on
horseback with the <span class="smcap">subalterns</span> and the
Escort. The <span class="smcap">first subaltern</span> mounts
upon a rock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: What do you see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Subaltern</span>: Nothing. The mountain shuts off
the view on this side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second Subaltern</span>: Why is it that the King did
not take his standard with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: I do not know for till to-day
I always stood at his side, when, at the crisis of the
battle, he mounted on his horse,</p>

<p>Holding the banner on which is shown the black and
terrible eagle</p>

<p>That soars towards the sun with the corpse of a man
in his talons.</p>

<p>And the sun one does not see, but all the banner is of
the color of gold.</p>

<p>But to-day he bade me remain behind at the place that
commands the deep defile</p>

<p>And wait till he returned or gave the signal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Subaltern</span>: The standard hangs without
movement upon its staff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: And we also remain motionless
at this threshold of the world.</p>

<p>By what a path we have come, rising out of the West
like a bird!</p>

<p>O young man new to the army,</p>

<p>Assuredly you will see the King of the world reigning,
but you have not seen what we have seen!</p>

<p>Terror and bewilderment march before him, and, as
if they did not know how to use them,</p>

<p>Armies lay down their arms upon the ground.</p>

<p>He has appeared in the midst of cowards,</p>

<p>He has rushed among the multitudes like a lion attacking
a drove of pigs!</p>

<p>And they have arisen against him like the sea, and they
have subsided and lapped the dust at his feet.</p>

<p>And now we appear at the door, confronting ancient
Asia!</p>

<p class="indic">(Gust of wind. Confused clamor in the distance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Subaltern</span>: Do you hear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second Subaltern</span>: At this very moment the
battle is being fought.</p>

<p class="indic">(Pause.</p>

<p>And what are we going to do now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: First for a long time</p>

<p>We must march across the level plain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Subaltern</span>: And then they say we shall
come upon a mountain</p>

<p>So high that it touches heaven, and out of heaven itself</p>

<p>Four rivers, as white as milk, descend to earth.</p>

<p>And passing on we shall behold again</p>

<p>The sea, like a brimming cup.</p>

<p>A land of gold is there and its fragrance alone is so
sweet</p>

<p>That it seems as if the soul were drawn from the body
as in a dream</p>

<p>And in the exultation of the woman who conceives.</p>

<p>The monkeys hide in flowering trees and the sand has
the scent of olives</p>

<p>And the submarine volcanoes appear like sunken lotus
flowers and like fountains of gushing wine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: All's one!</p>

<p>My will is to do the will of the King and to take my
stand at his side</p>

<p>Holding the Standard, and such is my portion of the
earth.</p>

<p>Assuredly it is just that we should adore like a god one
who commands with wisdom.</p>

<p>His heart is profound and he has been given the knowledge
of how to rule.</p>

<p>Thus his power increases, image of boldness divine
and of justice that cannot be moved,</p>

<p>Like a tree above a well where men and herds come
to drink.</p>

<p>And his spirit is like a marvellous fig tree</p>

<p>Together disclosing the flowers and the fruit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Subaltern</span>: As for the army that he has
brought to this place&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: Never has such an army been
seen! And one would think it was led by Love himself.</p>

<p>All see it from afar like a golden flower in the grass.</p>

<p>And, dearer than the face of his wife, each one of
these gross men</p>

<p>Bears graven on his heart the holy image of the King.</p>

<p>And there is no question of officers and soldiers, but
each one</p>

<p>Takes his part like a musician and they form a single
body,</p>

<p>And death has lost its meaning.</p>

<p class="indic">(Pause. Vague clamor in the distance. All
keep their eyes fixed on the Standard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Subaltern</span>: He has left behind the ancient
flag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: The Standard of the Empire
is here, but they march under various ensigns.</p>

<p>Many bear the image of the Sun</p>

<p>Who embraces the Heaven and the Earth, and arms
go out from his radiance.</p>

<p>Fishermen in a bark are throwing their net about him,
spurred foresters are mounting towards him through
the spreading oaks.</p>

<p>And those who have come from the place where the
earth, comes to an end</p>

<p>Hoist ocean weeds or the lead of the sounding-line,
and floating above them one sees</p>

<p>The Sword-fish with scarlet fins, or the god of the Sea,
with eyes of horn, disgorging his tongue like a stone,</p>

<p>Or the salutary sign of the cross with equal branches:</p>

<p>And such are the signs of those who live on the brink
of the deep abyss.</p>

<p>Other flags are green like a field, and grass is fastened
there and the hair of animals and bones and sacks
of earth.</p>

<p>The image of the wheat arises from the furrow amidst
a flight of pigeons with outspread wings; and words
come out of the mouth,</p>

<p>And the vine like a woman is bound upon the wine-press;</p>

<p>And something also recalls the Sun</p>

<p>When in September, after the harvest is gathered,</p>

<p>Like a pontiff who prostrates himself, he piously kisses
the naked earth.</p>

<p>Others still! And they represent nothing defined, but
are like a field of flowering buckwheat,</p>

<p>Or the shimmering azure, full of the leaves of peartrees,
when seen through the fringe of drooping
lashes,</p>

<p>Or an irruption of bees, or the seducing sea!</p>

<p>And others, stiff with embroidery, embody curious
legends,</p>

<p>A reaper plies his scythe; a naked man</p>

<p>Grasping a whip in both hands is fighting a four-winged
eagle of silver.</p>

<p>And others portray strange dreams; the disk of the
moon,</p>

<p>Dragons, panthers that eat the gods,</p>

<p>Or roses, and an embroidered briar.</p>

<p>But I could not tell you all the signs though I were to
speak forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second Subaltern</span>: There is one that you did
not mention.</p>

<p class="indic">(A great square of silk is hoisted above one of
the mountains to the East.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Subaltern</span>: Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: I do not know what it is! I
do not know what this means!</p>

<p class="indic">(A trumpet is heard sounding clearly as if it
announced something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Subaltern</span> (<i>shouting</i>): Listen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: I hear and I do not understand!</p>

<p>But I am struck with horror and my soul putrefies
within me.</p>

the wind.</p>

<p class="indic">(Pause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span> (<i>calling from below</i>): Ho!</p>

<p class="indic">(Echo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second Subaltern</span> (<i>bending over the precipice</i>):
There is someone below who signals that he wishes
to come up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: Make fast the tackle.</p>

<p>Lower away the cord.</p>

<p class="indic">(They do as he says. The cord runs out. Then
the soldiers pull it up and after a time an
armed man appears hanging from the rope.
He comes to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: Who are you, O man that
rises from the depths?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: Prostrate yourselves before me, for
on my tongue sits death!</p>

<p>I will tell you what I saw, and why I fled and could not
stay where I was, and called to you to draw me up
to this place and not to leave me below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: Say no more!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: I will announce the accursed thing</p>

<p>That you may fall to the earth like men deprived of
life,</p>

<p>For the King of men is dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> (<i>crying aloud</i>): Ho! ho!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: At least I will tell what I know, for
our detail was on guard at the crest of the mountain
yonder,</p>

<p>And we saw our army advance in good order across
the plain, and the men were like tiny specks.</p>

<p>And at noon they stopped to eat, and then resumed
their march, and always we followed them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: Well? Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: Then a smoke arose from the earth
and a thick dust blown by a violent wind, blotting
out the army,</p>

<p>And for long it hung above them so that we saw them
no more.</p>

<p>But when it was dissipated we perceived</p>

<p>An infinite army advancing to oppose them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: It is impossible! From whence
would it come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: I do not know. Perhaps the wind
brought them like lice.</p>

<p>But still we looked and, listen well to this,</p>

<p>We saw our army fleeing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: What tale is this?</p>

<p>Surely the dust was in your eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Messenger</span>: I say that they fled! And not one
of them remained</p>

<p>But we saw them run as fast as they were able.</p>

<p>And one man only remained, alone in the midst of the
plain and we recognised who it was</p>

<p>And then it was that I also</p>

<p>Fled, wishing to see no more.</p>

<p class="indic">(Profound silence. Pause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Subaltern</span> (<i>bending over the precipice</i>): I
see a crowd of men approaching at a gallop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Many Voices</span> (<i>calling from below</i>): Ho!</p>

<p class="indic">(Echo.</p>

<p class="indic">(They let down the rope after having fastened
a large plank to it by means of chains.</p>

<p class="indic">(The soldiers hoist the tackle. And soon over
the brink of the precipice, on the plank where
lies the body of <span class="smcap">tête-d'or</span>, emerges the
group of Captains, so crowded that some
dangle their legs in the void, and others are
clinging to the chains.</p>

<p class="indic">(The group rises almost to the height of the
sun, which it obscures, then the tackle turns
and the plank slowly descends to the earth.
They alight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Captain</span> (<i>shouting and indicating the Standard with
a gesture</i>): Rend the silk from the ensign and tear
the banner in two!</p>

<p>And take the staff and break it over your knee!</p>

<p>For now the eagle returns from a dolorous flight</p>

<p>Bearing the corpse of a man in its talons.</p>

<p>See what we bring, as we rise to this bleak and lofty
place,</p>

<p>That here we may hold the rites of burial, on this
portal of the world, at this place whence all the earth
is visible.</p>

<p>Thus about this dead body we re-assemble like birds.</p>

<p>Begone from us, O sun!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second</span>: O Tête-d'or! O master! O King! O King!</p>

<p>We have soared to this place, all your eaglets, bearing
you back with us.</p>

<p>O dead body!</p>

<p>Let the woman weep over her first-born son! The
man shall cry, mourning the death of his King, and
tears shall appear on his face,</p>

<p>And he shall not be comforted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third</span>: Begone from us, O sun! Leave us alone and
insult us no longer.</p>

<p>Now the earth turns its face towards night, and you,
who stood in your place like a mountain, disappear!
You see this, Father!</p>

<p>Look, we reveal him to you, that you may put your
mouth on our misery!</p>

<p>Now leave us alone that we may mourn this prey that
we hold between our hands.</p>

<p>O King! O King!</p>

<p>Like the Angel that bears the seal of life you rose
towards the Unchanging!</p>

<p>And now we bring you back with us, having lifted you
from the ground.</p>

<p>Gaze upon this! Behold it, mountains, and you O forests,
that sprang from the fraternal tree!</p>

<p>Let a shudder run through the roots of all that grows
because the King of men is dead!</p>

<p>O malediction on man! O death! O condemnation!</p>

<p>O prisoning place! O horror of the place in which
we are!</p>

<p>O King! O King!</p>

<p>You are dead and it is death we are holding in our
hands!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: Stop! Put an end to this
fury!&mdash;You force me to speak.</p>

<p>Grief, arises within me like the longing to vomit felt
by a woman with child,</p>

<p>And the tears that I would shed</p>

<p>Freeze, as when Christmas time prevents the winter
from weeping!</p>

<p>&mdash;Here! Lay him here, with funereal pomp expose
the royal body</p>

<p>On this square rock employed in ancient rites,</p>

<p>That the form of the bleeding man may there appear
once more</p>

<p>In the eyes of the heavens and the earth!</p>

<p>Bleeding, eyes closed, teeth showing,</p>

<p>His cheeks all crusted with sand!</p>

<p>Fetch water! Wash him! Let one of you become
his serving-maid!</p>

with scales of ash!</p>

<p>That this snout</p>

<p>Our leader is dead. O beasts, my brothers, hail!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span> (<i>to one of these who is caring

and you bury there the comb.</p>

<p>And also the comb buries itself in my soul and I see
this as though it were in a dream.</p>

<p>O soldiers, what has happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Centurion</span>: What do you wish to know?</p>

<p>Is not this enough? What more do you wish to learn?</p>

<p>Cursed be this country into which we have come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassius</span>: It is I who will speak and tell you everything.</p>

<p>And as it was I who announced victory so now shall I
proclaim death!</p>

<p>Certainly death was our guide</p>

<p>When counter to the course of the sun we advanced
across the infinite plain</p>

<p>And, looking back, beheld the mountains behind us.</p>

<p>At noon we sat and ate, then we took up our march
again.</p>

<p>But know that the heat was intolerable</p>

<p>And under the weight of their packs and arms the
soldiers died like flies,</p>

<p>For the sun consumed us and we could find no shelter.</p>

<p>And at two o'clock the wind arose, blowing the sand,</p>

<p>And we remained there swallowed up like men engulfed
in the earth,</p>

<p>And when we emerged from the dust,</p>

<p>We saw the red sun burning above our heads like a
Moloch,</p>

<p>And before us there lay an army.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Standard Bearer</span>: But what army?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassius</span>: Be still and do not uselessly interrupt me.</p>

<p>Assuredly antique humanity had come before its sister.</p>

<p>And as of old on the day of the separation we carefully
considered one another.</p>

<p>Their faces are nearer than ours to the color of the
earth,</p>

<p>And we saw in their hands the primitive arms and tools,
and in their midst were set the kings and the chieftains,
and above their heads the ancient idols swayed,</p>

<p>The squatting, three-faced monsters, each brandishing
six pairs of arms,</p>

<p>And camels also were there and ranks of elephants, and
tigers in wooden cages,</p>

<p>And we heard the hollow thunder of gongs.</p>

<p>Thus we gazed at each other,</p>

<p>For our forebears descended on Europe, who like a
man with outstretched arms lies upon the bosom of
the waters,</p>

<p>And theirs remained to multiply in the place in which
they were.</p>

<p>And we had lived our life in war and in tears, beset</p>

<p>By the spirits of turbulence and wrath that rise from
the restless and uninhabited sea.</p>

<p>And over them with hangman's hands had been securely
established the domination</p>

<p>Of Brahma, Prince of Error, and Buddha, the demon
of Peace,</p>

<p>And above us burned the inflamed face of the sun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: O!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassius</span>: There we were,</p>

<p>Hair full of sand, wading in sand up to the fleshy part
of the leg,</p>

<p>And seeing that multitude confronting us,</p>

<p>Fear entered into us and a distaste for fighting, and
for going forward forever on the face of that desert
land.</p>

<p>And we saw that we were few and dispersed and our
cannon were sunk in the sand.</p>

<p>And the King exhorted us, stretching out his arms,</p>

<p>And he pushed his horse here and there, but we did not
listen to him,</p>

<p>And we did not turn our eyes away from the foe,</p>

<p>And from their ranks.</p>

<p>As the nomads of the caravans are wont to cry to each
other with an enormous perforated shell, we heard
the blowing of a conch or horn!</p>

<p>O but the sound was sad and harsh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: O!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassius</span>: Thus did this primal people speak to us.</p>

<p>And nothing could longer restrain us, but the army like
one man irresistibly recoiled.</p>

<p>And, O shame, they began to flee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: O! O!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassius</span>: This the King saw and he did not try to prevent
it, and he alone remained.</p>

<p>Then he threw his sword to the ground, and dismounting
from his horse he unbridled it.</p>

<p>And alone he advanced against the opposing army,
holding the bit to heaven,</p>

<p>Thus we saw him advance</p>

<p>Like a wrathful pigeon that leaps towards the female
dragging its wings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: O!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassius</span>: This we saw! And they threw themselves
upon him tooth and nail like savage rats.</p>

<p>And there were some who took him by the arms and
others by the legs and others caught at his head
from behind,</p>

<p>And we, unhappy wretches, we saw him towering out
of the midst of them, engulfed as far as the girdle.</p>

<p>And he struggled like a horse that dogs have gripped
by the ears</p>

<p>Crying out in a dreadful voice, and with his loins dragging
his living prison this way and that!</p>

<p>And there was one who, holding his sword in both
hands,</p>

<p>Sought for the joint of the armor, like a cook who
opens a crab with the point of a knife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: O!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassius</span>: O!</p>

<p>What a clear and poignant cry we heard him give, like
mighty Pallas feeling the grasp of the Satyr,</p>

<p>Such that the memory of it made</p>

<p>Our bones vibrate like instruments!</p>

<p>And we recognised the voice as the woman knows the
cry of her mate,</p>

<p>And we also cried aloud and in frantic haste rushed
forward.</p>

<p>Three times we charged that multitude, and in the end,
yielding beneath our despair, they scattered like a
flock.</p>

<p>And as the affrighted Hindu</p>

<p>Turns in his course</p>

<p>To watch the wounded elephant, mad with pain,</p>

<p>Who pursues him like a mountain across the dazzling
ricefields, thus they saw our army charging close at
their heels.</p>

<p>And we found our king again, lying upon the ground,</p>

<p>Like a sack of gold that robbers had abandoned,</p>

<p>Dead, bereft of breath.</p>

<p>And now we return bearing away this spoil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice</span>: O! Alas! O King, O King!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassius</span>: Cry louder! Let the earth be broken in two!</p>

<p>Let the revelation of the sun be quenched!</p>

<p>Let the Tree of Eternity, that like oranges bears the
worlds</p>

<p>And like apples and like sugared figs and grapes,</p>

<p>Crash down its roots in air!</p>

<p>For man has terminated here his greatest enterprise.
Now all is ended.</p>

<p>And he did not prevail</p>

<p>Against the power that holds things in place.</p>

<p>Cry louder!</p>

<p>Let your tears pour forth in floods! Go to your homes
and throw yourselves on the ground!</p>

<p>As for me, O King, I loved you.</p>

<p>You were my life and with wonder I looked upon you,
King of men!</p>

<p>And your herald goes before you!</p>

the holy bonds of your inheritance!</p>

<p>Take a resolution and steadfastly follow it! Tread
everything under your feet, your wife and your
house and yourself, as you would tread on a garment.
Beware of any change! For aside from
yourself what is there, can you tell me? And you
yourself are something.&mdash;Lay your foundations
there.</p>

<p>Of yourselves alone are you surely masters. Beware

<p>Through this same meek courage with which you have
dragged me here, through this naive endurance,</p>

<p>The woman in her sphere is the image of an inspired
resignation, teaching good will to men,</p>

of God.</p>

<p>And it is you</p>

<p>Who join me once more in this place where I must
perish!</p>

<p>It is needful at times that the woman, wife or nurse,</p>

<p>Consider it! I was man! And through me the
strength of the man has satisfied his will,</p>

<p>Young girl, can you hear me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Commander</span>: Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: Why should I hide it? Your former
King who was killed by that man there....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Commander</span>: Are you his daughter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Princess</span>: I am.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
